## Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] **MPRIS Integration**: Control playback and volume from system media controllers.
- [ ] **Cross-fade Transitions**: Smoothly fade sounds in and out when switching presets or stopping.
- [x] **Custom Sound Support**: Ability to add personal `.ogg` or `.mp3` files to a user-defined folder.
- [ ] **Environmental Effects**: Basic filters (e.g., "Muffled/Behind Wall" effect) using mpv's audio filters.
- [ ] **Advanced Scheduling**: Set timers or calendar-based triggers to auto-start specific soundscapes.
- [ ] **Dynamic Soundscapes**: Sounds that vary slightly over time to prevent "loop fatigue."
